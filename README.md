A collection of simple games for young children.  Specifically, these are games
written for my daughter to play.  The general principles are:

* Free:  No ads.  No personal data collection.  No micro-payments.
* Simple graphics:  Minimize addiction by not using flashy animations.
* Intellectual:  Games are more about logical thought than reaction times.
* Hackable:  Programmed in pure JavaScript so anyone (even kids!) can modify.
* Client-side:  No server, can be run offline from a folder on disk.

Feedback and contributions welcome.
